# Random Table Topic Generator

Random Table Topic Generator generates a random number of table topics depending on the number submitted, and the categories chosen.

As a member of ToastMasters we are periodically asked to answer a “Table Topic” question. Table Topic questions impromptu questions that are asked to various people. The purpose of table topics is to have members "think on their feet" and speak for one to two minutes. This can help people prepare for unexpected questions that may be asked during job interviews, news interviews, and business meetings. These questions normally last one to two minutes.
